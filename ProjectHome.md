android-gps-test is a GPS location emulator for changing/setting/simulating the GPS location of the Android emulator/device through a simple map-based interface. You can add the location to Favorites.

This app sets up mock GPS location so every other app in your phone belive you are there!

## Note ##

  * Disable "Use wireless networks" in Setting/Location of your phone since some apps use it too
  * Always run MockGPS before running other apps to be mocked otherwise they will use the default GPS sensor instead of MockGPS's.
  * Check your android settings: Settings->Applications->Development->Allow mock locations, make sure this item is checked.
